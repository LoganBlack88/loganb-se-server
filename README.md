# LOGANB PRIVATE DEDICATED SPACE ENGINEER SERVER:


## Server Details:  

**Host IP/Port:**  192.169.93.172:29016

**Server Host:**  GTXGaming

**Server Location:** Chicago

**Server Player Max:** 10

**Server Type:** Torch. (This is a community made server that allows some extremely helpful plugins to patch functionality that is missing from vanilla.) 



## GAME SETTINGS: 
**Game Mode:**  Survival (+ wolves and spiders turned on.)

**Environment Hostility:** Safe. (This just means there's no meteors. They spawn way too often, target only players (not empty blocks), and chew up the terrain. There are almost no upsides and they're fairly annoying / unrealistic.) 

**Inventory Size Mulitplier:**  5.0

**Assembler Speed Multiplier:**  5.0

**Assembler Efficiency Multiplier:**  5.0

**Refinery Speed Mulitplier:** 5.0



## RULES: 
1. Be cool, don't fuck up people's shit.
2. Don't give Adam a gun.
3. Join "Dem Bois" faction so that we can share resources with players. Or don't and be a loner. 



## TORCH PLUGINS INSTALLED: 

#### Concealment: 

Dynamically pauses grids ingame to improve sim speed. Has options for distance from players, active production blocks, and presence of certain blocks to control whether a grid is concealed or not.

* https://wiki.torchapi.net/index.php/Plugins/Concealment
* **NOTE,** this could cause your grids to be paused when you walk too far away from them, effecting our ability to do some automated tasks. You should be able to override it, but this might take some learning to get used to.

#### Essentials: 

Adds many utilities and chat commands to dedicated servers.  (E.g., this should allow me to add a 15 minute warning script before server restarts!!)  Also, it adds a few player-usable commands for the chat. See the wiki link for details.

#### FactionPaint: 
Allows players to paint blocks that are owned by their faction members, themselves, or nobody.  (I heard complaints about not being able to paint ships we build for each other. This should fix that?)

#### PerformanceTweaker: 
By default, turrets run updates every 1 ms/tick, which is a lot. When there are no targets, turrets will run in "cold" mode which throttles the update to every 100 ticks/ms instead. When a target is acquired, turrets will switch back to "hot" (update every 1 ms/tick). After the target is gone for 300 ms/ticks, they will go "cold" again. (These are the defaults and can be configured.)

#### Profiler:
A Torch plugin that adds tools for exploring causes of lag.

## STEAM WORKSHOP MODS INSTALLED: 


### UI MODS: 

#### Colorful Icons: 
Gives color to the vanilla menu icons, instead of the vanilla drab blue. Helps you find stuff faster,  and is easier on the eyes, IMO.

* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=801185519

#### HUD Colors:
Gives the HUD some more color instead of the vanilla drab blue. (E.g., the health, energy, o2, hydrogen bars.) 

* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=889485290


#### HUD Compass:  
Adds a compass bar to the top of the window. (Similiar to PUBGs compass.) 

*  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1469072169




### TILE SET MODS: 

#### Concrete Armor Blocks (DX11/PBR): 
Adds concrete variants of the "Light/Heavy Armor Block" tiles that are made from gravel. (Which is otherwise a waste product in vanilla.) 

* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=303959338
* NOTE! There is a comment on the mod page that thrusters don't damage concrete but, because concrete doesn't deform, it could damage / explode your thrusters! Be careful. If this causes problems, LMK and we can uninstall.

#### Corner Lights:  
Adds better-looking (IMO) corner light options. (With different color settings!) Basically just cosmetic.

* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=530693136&searchtext=lights 

#### Small Advanced Rotor:
Adds an Advanced Rotor for small block. (The vanilla small block advanced rotor is actually large for some god-forsaken reason...) 

* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=381591639&searchtext=small+advanced+rotor

#### Small Flight Seat: 
Adds a "Flight Seat" for the small grid blocks.

* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=661343416

#### Stone Duster: 
Basically a cleaner, lag-friendlier way of getting rid of your stone. Turns it to "dust" (deletes it) rather than throwing it on the ground. (Should help with server lag a little since the game doesn't have to track those assets.)
